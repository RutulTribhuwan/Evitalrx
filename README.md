I have successfully developed all the required functionalities in Angular, including the landing page, login page, dashboard, form for adding patients and placing orders, and the checkout page. All of these components are functioning as expected.

I have also verified the API responses using Postman and received the correct data, which confirms that the API is working properly. Despite this, I am currently encountering an issue when trying to fetch the data from the API within the Angular application.

To address this, I have ensured that the Angular HttpClient module is properly imported and configured. The service that handles the API calls is also correctly set up, and the API endpoint URLs and headers are accurately defined. The issue seems to be in the data fetching integration within Angular.

To troubleshoot, I have checked the following:

Ensuring that the API calls are correctly invoked within the Angular components.
Verifying that the observable returned by the HttpClient is properly subscribed to and the data is being processed correctly.
Checking the console for any errors or messages that might indicate what is going wrong.
Confirming that CORS policies are not affecting the API calls.
I have attached the response from Postman to demonstrate that the API is functioning as expected. Your understanding and any further insights on resolving this integration would be greatly appreciated
